This is a cutom-made ESP32 project that can detect when the Amazon Echo (2nd gen) trigger light is on or off.

This can be useful in scenarios were the Amazon Echo is placed in a room with a lot of background noise such as TVs and avoid undesired commands.

The tutorial will guide you how to build your own hardware and connect it to Home Assistant using the ESPHome integration.
